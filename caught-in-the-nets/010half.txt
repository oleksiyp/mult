  Machine Learning Applied To Real World Quant Strategies

I'm sure you've noticed the oversaturation
of beginner Python tutorials and
stats/machine learning references
available on the internet.

Few tutorials actually tell you how to
apply them to your algorithmic trading
strategies in an end-to-end fashion.

There are hundreds of textbooks, research
papers, blogs and forum posts on time
series analysis, econometrics, machine
learning and Bayesian statistics.

Nearly all of them concentrate on the
theory.

What about practical implementation? How
do you use that method for your
strategy? How do you actually program up
that formula in software?

I've written Advanced Algorithmic Trading
to solve these problems.

  We don’t save for the future because we lie to ourselves. 
This app might change that

I personally belive this author because
of the book Predictably Irrational.

And that's his final findings.

As humans, our failings are epic. We
eat too much, lie to ourselves, never
exercise enough, and spend so much money
we have nothing left for that vacation
in Hawaii. But technology, Dan Ariely
believes, might save us from ourselves.

Ariely says the app will force people
to think about the opportunity cost of
money, or what you give up (saving for
college) to get what you want (another
bottle of rare gin). You can create a
goal—a $300 budget for groceries—and
an anti-goal—whatever is not spent from
that $300 goes toward something else
(Ariely is saving for a car). You can
pre-assign money to do the things you
mean to do but don’t do. Every time you
spend $3 on coffee, you can donate $1 to
your favorite charity (and perhaps start
curbing your expensive coffee habit).

  More Evidence that Income Inequality Sucks

The world is slowly reaching the
conclusion that income inequality is
toxic for human welfare. Books such
as The Spirit Level, Why Nations Fail,
and Capital in the 21st Century make the
case at the macro scale by chronicling
the fate of nations. In the United
States of America, income inequality has
swung like a slow pendulum, reaching
an extreme during the Gilded Age and
today. Well-being has swung in the reverse
direction, as shown in this remarkable
graph compiled by Evolution Institute
Vice President Peter Turchin (go here
for details).

IMG:001-inequality.jpg

A new study provides more evidence for
the toxic effects of inequality, if more
is needed. A team of economists led by
Robert H. Frank measured changes in income
inequality in each of the states and in
the 100 most densely populated counties
in America during the period 1990-2000

  Facebook's code quality problem

Facebook has a software quality
problem. I’m going to try to convince
you with three examples. This is important
because it demonstrates the time-honored
principle that quality matters. In
demonstrates it, as Facebook engineers
like to say, at scale. I don’t work at
Facebook or any competitor, I’m just
an observer.

  Cats!

Now it’s time for us, the third
generation of quantum scientists, to
give quantum mechanics the reputation
it deserves: that of a beautiful and
simple theory that should be understood
by as many people as possible. Here at
the Institute for Quantum Computing,
we are making great efforts to share our
research and teach quantum theory to our
community. Every year we host around 40
high school students from Canada and the
world and teach them the basics of quantum
mechanics in the Quantum Cryptography
School for Young Students. IQC has also
recently started a training program called
Teaching Quantum Technology, aimed for
teachers who are interested in introducing
the ideas behind quantum mechanics and
their application to technology in their
classrooms. Recently, we even created a
video game: Quantum Cats! This is only an
example of a worldwide trend to spread
our knowledge of quantum mechanics, a
movement that is guided by the conviction
that Bohr and Feynman were wrong: anyone
can understand quantum mechanics.

  as quantum: Why we think like quarks?

The fuzziness and weird logic of the way
particles behave applies surprisingly well
to how humans think

IMG:003-qminds.jpg

THE quantum world defies the rules of
ordinary logic. Particles routinely occupy
two or more places at the same time and
don’t even have well-defined properties
until they are measured. It’s all
strange, yet true – quantum theory is
the most accurate scientific theory ever
tested and its mathematics is perfectly
suited to the weirdness of the atomic
world.

Yet that mathematics actually stands
on its own, quite independent of the
theory. Indeed, much of it was invented
well before quantum theory even existed,
notably by German mathematician David
Hilbert. Now, it’s beginning to look as
if it might apply to a lot more than just
quantum physics, and quite possibly even
to the way people think.

Human thinking, as many of us know,
often fails to respect the principles
of classical logic. We make systematic
errors when reasoning with probabilities,
for example. Physicist Diederik Aerts
of the Free University of Brussels,
Belgium, has shown that these errors
actually make sense within a wider logic
based on quantum mathematics. The same
logic also seems to fit naturally with
how people link concepts together, often
on the basis of loose associations and
blurred boundaries. That means search
algorithms based on quantum logic could
uncover meanings in masses of text more
efficiently than classical algorithms

  issue and how to solve?

Soon: Artificial trees will save our
atmosphere from CO2 emission

The scientists came to the conclusion that
they can put the climate global warming on
hold on position with artificial trees and
their job will be to consume the CO2 out
from the atmosphere. Yes of course this
is possible! The scientists developed
a new technology of material that can
extract CO2 from the atmosphere and to
condense into fibers. That kind of fiber
also can be used in electronics, cars,
buildings, clothing and other manufactured
products. They said that artificial trees
will return our atmospheric CO2 to pre
industrial decade.

  Researchers Create Better Algorithm for Simulating Particles in Fermi Sea

A North Carolina State University
physicist and his German colleagues have
created a new, more precise algorithm
for simulating particle interactions
when a single impurity is introduced
into a Fermi sea. The algorithm shows
that when these particles interact, the
transition from quasiparticle to bound
molecule in a polarized two-dimensional
system is smooth. The new method may
have implications for understanding
the behavior of impurities in a variety
of systems.

The Fermi sea describes a collection of
weakly interacting identical fermions such
as electrons that have been cooled to a
very low temperature. No two fermions
within the sea have exactly the same
quantum state. The ground state of the
Fermi sea in this pure form is well
understood. However, what happens when
an impurity – such as a particle with
a different spin – is introduced? How
does that one particle affect the system
as a whole?

  Hidden Reasons People Spend Too Much

You can get all the basics right and yet
still break your budget. Researchers are
beginning to discover why

“The lesson here is to be a little
bit thoughtful about your spending,
where the money is coming from and the
costs associated with that, rather than
taking a rule given to you and using it
for everything,” she says.

Stop spending to reward yourself Many
people go awry in their spending because
of the way they view willpower—and what
they feel they deserve for using it.

Studies have found that some people
imagine willpower as something that is
a limited resource and is fairly easily
depleted, while others see it as something
abundant that doesn’t run out. That
leads to very different behavior in times
of stress. People who think willpower
is limited think they deserve to reward
themselves for showing some willpower,
while people who think it’s unlimited
think no reward is needed or deserved.

Mind your mood when spending

Other research has begun to explore the
tangled relationship between moods and
money habits. When people are sad, their
habits are worse. When they are happy,
their habits are better. Even if money
can’t buy happiness, it seems that
happiness can buy money.

Don’t let your home equity tempt you

Finally, people display a blind spot
when it comes to their homes. Many
people spend more when the value
of their assets—particularly their
property—goes up, even though in reality
those assets often won’t add to their
spending power in the future. In fact, for
each $1 increase in the market value of a
home, certain households increased their
consumption by six cents to 18 cents,
according to a 2013 study in the Review
of Economics and Statistics.

In general, Mr. Cooper says that
people need to think about their homes
not as an investment, not even as
a regular financial asset, but as a
place to live. What’s more, people
shouldn’t think about a home as a
tool for borrowing more money. “If you
max out your home-equity line of credit
and then housing prices change, chances
are you will find yourself financially
constrained,” he says.

  why you could stop learning it right now

Everything You Know Is Wrong: The Boston
Tea Party

IMG:006-tea-party.jpg

What people call history is really
myth. History is a tale told by bloody
conquerors, failed novelists, and small
town football coaches earning their keep
in public schools. It’s a system of
power. He who controls the past controls
the future. He who controls the present
controls the past. Court historians
regard the myth as sacrosanct. They never
question its veracity and are quick to
deride anyone who voices doubt.

Americans spend their school years
struggling to memorize names and dates. In
the decades afterward, they take pride in
the scattering of facts they manage to
retain. So, of course, they get pretty
upset when you show them most of those
precious facts were lies.

But for those with an open mind,
those last few willing to question
anything and anyone, discovering the
truth is exhilarating. Truth is what
we’re after. We’ll chase it down
whether it sets us free as Jesus said it
would, or destroys us like Oedipus. In
each installment of Everything You
Know Is Wrong, I examine unquestioned
facts—historic, scientific, social, and
religious—to reveal the truth beneath
the myth.

  part IV: life cylces

In the current vernacular we no longer
speak about development life-cycles but
instead about Agile and its variants. And
if one were to review the documents
promoting Agile and the components
that make up what appears to be it’s
framework it could be found that Agile is
nothing more than a variant on existing
life-cycles as defined by software
engineering practitioners. Steven
McConnell of Construx Software is
aware of this since he wrote the book
on standardised software engineering
practices. And though he propose the use
of Agile techniques his interpretation
of these techniques are well founded
upon long standing software engineering
principles.

  yet another stellarator

Germany is about to start up a monster
machine that could revolutionise the way
we use energy

For more than 60 years, scientists have
dreamed of a clean, inexhaustible energy
source in the form of nuclear fusion.

And they’re still dreaming.

But thanks to the efforts of the Max
Planck Institute for Plasma Physics,
experts hope that might soon change.

Last year, after 1.1 million construction
hours, the Institute completed the
world’s largest nuclear fusion machine
of its kind, called a stellarator.

They call it this 52-foot wide machine
the W7-X.

And following more than a year of tests,
engineers are finally ready to fire up the
$US1.1 billion machine for the first time,
and it could happen before the end of this
month, "Science" reported.

  Just Brain Rules for Presenters

We know that it takes you about 10
minutes to lose an audience if you’re
just giving a normal talk. So at the
nine-minute-and-59-second mark, you have
to do something fairly radical. In fact,
you should do it within 30 seconds of your
first words, but certainly at nine minutes
and 59 seconds. And here is where we can
get into some brain science.

It’s pretty simple. When a piece of
information comes into the brain, your
brain immediately interrogates it with six
questions right off the bat. And you can
see the Darwinian roots of the brain’s
processing features really clearly here.

The first question it will ask is, will
it eat me? You’re going to make an
assessment of threat; that’s a survival
mechanism. The second question is, can
I eat it? Question number three is, can
I have sex with it? And it’s actually
not even sex per se. It’s, is there
reproductive opportunity?

Question number four is, can it have
sex with me? Questions number five
and six to me are professionally the
most interesting, because there’s no
a priori for them. It just shows you
something about how the brain learns:
Have I seen it before? Or, have I never
seen it before? The reason why is, the
brain is an unbelievably gifted pattern
matcher, and it’s looking for patterns
that it’s seen.
